# FamilyMap
An Android application what was a project for C S 240 which now uses a different project and so I made this public to show an interesting app that I built from scratch using Java and Android Studio. I included documentation of the project description for reference. A video of the client specs can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erjZcIDL9ek
